- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zac Centracchio
- I am in my 4th year at Drexel University. I am majoring in Game Design and Production, focusing on technical art and design.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on challenging projects that will help me develop my skills as a game designer.
- My email is Zachary.Centracchio@gmail.com if you would like to chat.
- I have worked on 2 large-scale projectsâ€”one at my internship at Dream Syndicate and one at my own company Saphead Studios.
- I am still new to GitHub so I am still trying to upload all my work to show my true skills.
